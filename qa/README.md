# QA assignment

## Overview
The product owner wants to improve the page "Compare Mac models" (https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/).

## Feature description:
As a potential customer, I want to hide or eliminate the products based on basic filters:
- Laptop/Desktop computer
- Price Range (< $1500, $1500 to $2500, > $2500)
- Usage (Home use, Professional use)

The UX team is planing on putting these filters in a dedicated area (below the text "Get help buying. Chat live now or call 1-800-MY-APPLE.", and above the list of products).

## Questions
1. If you need to clarify any aspect of the requirements, what questions would you ask to the product owner or UX?
    - (It's ok to make assumption, just clarify what they are)

2. Attempt to categorize tests into manual, acceptance, integration and unit test categories
    - See https://dzone.com/articles/the-battle-of-the-testing-triangle

3. What would be your strategy to test and validate this feature?

4. Describe the acceptance criteria using Gherkin (see appendix below)

## What we are looking for?
- We want to see how you approach the problem and get an idea of what is your mindset.
- We're expecting your answers in a document or a simple email.

## Appendix

#### GHERKIN

> "Gherkin is a plain-text language with a little extra structure. 
Gherkin is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, 
yet structured enough to allow concise description of examples 
to illustrate business rules in most real-world domains."
